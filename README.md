# IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone

This is a part of the IBM Applied Data Science Specialization.

In this capstone, we take the role of a data scientist	working for a new rocket company called SpaceY.

With the help of the data science findings and models in this report, SpaceY will be able to make more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

Given mission parameters such as payload mass and desired orbit, the models produced in this report were able to predict the first stage rocket booster landing successfully with an accuracy level of 90%.
